## Introduction

Data conversion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. This repository provides examples of converting data between different formats, such as characters to binary, binary to decimal, and decimal to binary. These examples are implemented in Java and are designed to be easy to understand and modify.

## Features

- Convert characters to binary representation
- Convert binary numbers to decimal
- Convert decimal numbers to binary
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Modular structure for easy extension and modification

## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language used for implementing the data conversion examples

## Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
